I would like to retract the comments made in my [previous post](tripod-mount-prod-page.html) and apologize; I think the smartphone tripod mount I first acquired was unusually substandard, and made me believe that tripod mounts in general were more unaccommodating to different phone thicknesses than they actually are. I have since picked up a tripod smartphone mount that isn't garbo, and it fits my phone, bulky case and all, just fine. Sorry to anyone who may have been hurt by my statements.
