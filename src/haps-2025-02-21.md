Things are going okay. Haven't missed a training session in this cycle; eating well; sleeping well (minus the temperature - can't nail the goldilocks zone for some reason). Started drinking tea in the morning for the caffeine energy boost; so far so good. 

Not much to report overall, but not in a bad way.
