Slow days. Somewhat malaised this week after binging Cyberpunk Edgerunners; hard not to see its particular flavor of bleak mirrored quite strongly in my actual life. 

Pretty weak [Horror Every Day October](https://letterboxd.com/egghorn/films/diary/for/2024/10/) this year; started strong and didn't finish it out. Action film moratorium still on. Plans to get back to working through the Noah Buschel filmography. Currently reading Iain Banks's Excession after bouncing off Le Morte d'Arthur; playing a bunch of Into the Breach again. Looking forward to this month's basho; Takerufuji's back in makuuchi and it should  be cool to see how they and Onosato match up.

One positive is we've picked up an molecular COVID test reader and are testing weekly; more certainty around our health status.
