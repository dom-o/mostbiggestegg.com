## Pictures
- Full front view. Classic for a reason. Show the entire board. Opportunity to include measurements for length/width.

- 3/4 view. If your board is asymmetrical, include 3/4 view of the OTHER SIDE.

- Hold measurements picture. No need to get too detailed; save that for the description. For edges include depth in mm (better) or inches (okay) and degree of incut ('flat', 'slopey', 'incut' is sufficient detail here); for pinches include width ('narrow'/'wide' is sufficient detail); for slopers include degree (use degrees); for pockets include depth. For jugs it's generally sufficient just to indicate 'jug', but make sure the jug is visible in another picture - not all jugs are created equal.

- Side view is usually more important for individual holds than for hangboards. If you're displaying a hold, a campus rung, etc, this is a must. Utility of this view for hangboards depends on the board; can be an opportunity to detail the jug. Opportunity to include height/depth measurements.


After you have these things, individualize all you like. Include your action shots, close up detail shots of features, what-have-you; I personally like user-submitted photos of their setups to get a better feel for how the board fits into an actual training space.

## Description
- Dimensions: height, width, depth. If your board is in two pieces, include dimensions per piece, not dimensions for the full board.

- Hold measurements. Restate the information in the hold measurements picture and add detail where possible. For edges include depth as detailed above, degree of incut (use degrees this time), and radius information - actual radius in inches/mm of course, but ideally supplement with more intuitive qualitative details ('sharp', 'comfortable', 'slopey'). Include depth for pockets. I do think it's implied that most pockets are relatively comfy/generally flat; be explicit about incut/radius anyway. For slopers, include degrees as above and for pinches include width in edges/mm; also indicate any other unique quality, e.g. pinch flaring/tapering.

- Indicate the distance between pairs of holds. Do not say 'shoulder-width'; break out the ruler and give me a number.

- Mounting details: what kind of screws, how many, are they included. Use standard terminology here; if I go to Home Depot, show this section to an employee, and leave without the right screw for any reason other than 'we don't carry that screw here' or 'that screw isn't in stock right now', you have failed.

- If the wood/specific PU blend of your board matters, include how/why; that being said, everyone says their specific thing is the perfect blend of sticky and skin-friendly.

- Include width/height of the specific hold slots. Specifically I'd like to know if they'll fit the Problemsolver inserts; I use them to modify edge sizes and on some boards the slots are too short to allow them in.


 Again, after you have this stuff, go nuts with whatever else you want. I personally like to see user reviews.
