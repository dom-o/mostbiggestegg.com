I feel like I got nothing. The last three weeks slid by and I ain't done a thing. 

Not true actually; as I type it comes back to me: 
- We have applied for and been approved for SNAP benefits and Medicaid. 
- Been doing Dan John's Easy Strength in the gym. Easy Strength Omnibook is phenomenal. 
- Have been slacking on finding a new roommate for next year. Not good.
- Learning vim; using it for this very post.
- Rewatched Fury Road the other day.
