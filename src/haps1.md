Life update and that.

Physically: the thing is increasing our ambient activity levels after being sedentary for so long, and prepping the tweaky joints for a return to more strenuous training. Six weeks of [Knee Ability Zero](https://mailchi.mp/284f5262674e/knee-ability-for-life-july-6056807?e=[UNIQID]), [Power ForeArms!](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwNZ-v76jOCwcjFEOG9GN19SNnM/edit?resourcekey=0-uZux16MqNIfv56FXCbD5xw) (shoutout [Phil Requist](http://www.jessery.com/p/blog-page.html)), and Javorek's Shoulder Reconditioner for the latter. For former, starting each day with a bit of yoga into a tabata interval into sitting in a deep squat for a bit, plus getting in a minimum amount of easy calisthenic work throughout the day (shoutout Mythical Strength for both the [daily work](https://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2021/01/things-i-like-right-now.html) concept and the [tabata](http://mythicalstrength.blogspot.com/2022/07/seriously-you-have-5-minutes.html) idea). Daily work has already hit roadbump; we started doing pullups in sets of 10, hit some persistent soreness that evolved into minor pain through the movement, and now are reduced to 1 pullup a day mostly as a check to see if it still hurts. Everything else is fine.

Still working at the waffle joint; still we harbor a firm belief that everyone who goes to restaurants should be killed. They took away our ability to control the music in the space so the job is a lot less fun than it used to be. Still incredible we can survive off three days of work a week (although we are quite poor - not the greatest).

Currently reading [Gendlin's Focusing](http://bewelltuned.com/gendlins_focusing) and Baldwin's Jimmy's Blues and Other Poems; watching a good amount of [films](https://letterboxd.com/egghorn/) - most recently God of Cookery (which we bounced off of unfortunately). 

Quite lonely still; we gotta make some COVID conscious friends soon bec we grow weary of wasting away in our room. Have heard Roboto's requiring masks still; must investigate.
