title: "A Running List of Gripes I Have with Readwise Reader"
---
Eventually I will fancy this up and post it to the readwise subreddit for the team to read. For now though, it's here.

- One time I tried to save a Tumblr post and it saved literally everything but the post text. I'm talking the entire 'related posts' infinite scroll, the sidebar, everything.
- Doesn't embed vimeo videos.
- Can't do column view for youtube videos (ie. video in one column, transcript in the other).
- Annoying scrolling through youtube transcripts while the video is playing. For some reason it shows current position at the top, so the rest of the transcript is useless stuff you haven't seen, instead of current position being like 3/4 of the way down, so you can see/review the stuff you just watched/heard, and there's still a little bit of preview. 
- Whenever I get Dwarf Fortress progress log RSS updates it doesn't wrap the text and it gets cut off the side on mobile.
