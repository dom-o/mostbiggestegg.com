Literally just this: the range of phone THICKNESSES your thing can accommodate.

This is the make or break measurement. Not width; phones do not vary significantly in width and you know it. Phones vary in thickness. I can put a case on any given phone that will make it double in thickness, so you, product vendor, tell me how thick my phone can be before it doesn't fit in your fucking thing. Give me the information I need to decide whether or not I should buy your item. You fuck.
