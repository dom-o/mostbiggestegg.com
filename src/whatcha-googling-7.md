They say you reveal who you are via what you ask the oracle, and google is hell closer than Delphi. 

New format for these; I am going to explain myself a little. Hopefully this gives you yet more insight into my character - who I be.

To that end, I have recently searched for all the following:
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=david+hornes+thumbscrews">david hornes thumbscrews</a><dt>
<dd>Apparently this is an alternative implement to the <a href="https://www.ironmind-store.com/Titans-Telegraph-Key153-I/productinfo/1243/">Titan's Telegraph Key</a>, which I am considering buying.</dd>
<dt><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wrist+flexion+muscles">wrist flexion muscles</a><dt>
