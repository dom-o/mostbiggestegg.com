Read this a while ago. I personally don't know much about Alwyn Cosgrove, and I'd heard of only one or two of the people he interviews in this, but I know the strength and conditioning world is vast and I'm not plugged into it. I've heard good things about Cosgrove from Steve Bechtel and that is good enough for me to assume these people know their stuff somewhat.

Content-wise there's nothing ground-breaking for me. It's interesting to hear these people's thoughts but I'm not making any drastic changes to my training based off this, save one: post-workout drink. Bar none, all the interviewees recommend an immediate post-workout drink of some kind; will include this from now on.
