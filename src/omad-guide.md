title: Uncle Egg's One Meal A Day (OMAD) meal template

Putting this out bec I am not trying to lose weight; the other recipes I've seen are geared toward that and tend to generate smaller meals than I'd like. I personally like OMAD as a timesaver instead - you spend minimal time in the kitchen, you needn't do dishes all the damn time, etc - so calorie cutting I don't need.

The meal is:
<ul>
	<li>rice</li>
 	<li>protein; pick at least 2 sources.<br>
 			some ideas: canned beans, eggs (at least 2), some meat (we do a lot of chicken breast and salmon)
	</li>
	<li>vegetables; pick at least 4 different ones, at least 1 each raw/cooked.<br>
		some ideas: pepper, eggplant, kale, radish, asparagus, onion, mushroom, spinach, beet, broccoli, carrot, radicchio, arugula, zucchini, brussels sprouts, celery, green onion, lettuce, cucumber, cauliflower, tomato, leek, sprouts
	</li>
	<li>nuts/seeds, a couple handfuls.<br>
		some ideas: walnut, pecan, pistachio, peanuts, chia seeds, pepitas, sunflower seeds, pine nuts, flaxseed meal
	</li>
	<li>something fermented; I usually do sauerkraut</li>
	<li>raw garlic</li>
	<li>olives (optional)</li>
	<li>cheese (optional)</li>
	<li>sauces/spices (optional)</li>
</ul>

Easy meal to prep for; easy meal to cook, esp with a rice cooker. I toss whatever vegetables I want tender in there, plus the meat; it'll cook it fine if it's a thin enough cut. While it runs I chef up any last little thing, and once it's done we pop a couple eggs in to cook off the residual heat. Combine all ingredients in big bowl; enjoy.
