Once upon a time I was a kid in high school. I had to take notes for class; in a couple years I'd have to take more notes for more class for college. If I could write faster I could take better notes. If I could write fast enough I could take down a whole lecture verbatim; no information lost. Ultimate note taking. How do I write faster? Think: information dense writing systems.

Heard about [Ithkuil](http://www.ithkuil.net/). Ithkuil is not for taking notes though.

Heard about [Gregg shorthand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregg_shorthand). Gregg shorthand was too boring to sit down and learn for high school me (I regret this one; Gregg is cool. Superman knows it), with added drawback of incomprehensibility to all my contemporaries.

Learned about something else. Don't remember what it was called (smalltalk? fastwrite? speedwrite? something like that). Reasonably faster to write than regular printed English, but more importantly easy to learn and reasonably legible to others. It was and still is a handy system for me. I cannot find the post on it anymore, and so I describe it here that it might not be lost.

It goes like this:
  1. spell everything phonetically
  2. elide short vowels, except those at the beginning of a word
      - I started using the arabic short vowels in cases where omitting entirely impedes comprehension
  3. for 'ch' use *c*, for 'sh' use *z*
      - for 'th' I use the thorn or *ħ*

Now, some passages both in plain English and abbreviated, for comparison:

>I will warn you now that this will be very lengthy, but for those of you here to learn about tulpas and how to create one, I recommend that you read the whole thing. This guide is targeted both at newcomers who don’t know, or have just a vague idea what tulpas are, and people who have already begun creating a tulpa and are having trouble. This guide is meant to be definitive—discussing almost all that you could possibly need to know about tulpa-creation. It will discuss many concepts, as well as the entire process, and the mindset you should have during it.

>We often think that to get slaw cooler, crisper, and lighter, the mayo needs to go. But why take out all the joy? Instead lighten the salad by replacing sturdy wintertime cabbage with featherweight napa. Shredded chicken fits right in, sliced almonds and sesame seeds add a little crunch, and ginger brightens up the dressing. If you’d rather steer the flavors in another direction, go for it, but whatever you do, don’t be shy about the mayonnaise. Add as much as you like, you crazy cat.

>Another necessary piece of equipment is a single-burner element buffet range with infinite temperature control. It is perfect for every heating operation and only costs about $20 at a department store. Finally, a couple of ringstands with a few Fisher clamps are used to hold the glassware in position.

>I’m repeating this often-told story because it fits so perfectly. Norb Schemansky was approached by an eager fan and asked, “How do I get my press stronger?” Ski replied, “Press.” Good advice: the press needs to be worked often and diligently. When the lift was part of Olympic lifting competition, most lifters did presses at every session in the weight room, and they often worked them to limit no less than once a week. It’s the kind of lift that has to be leaned on, much like the squat. This means that if you want to move the numbers up on the press, you will need to work them at least twice a week. If you’re also doing some of the exercises that I’m about to recommend, you can get by with pressing heavy once a week.
