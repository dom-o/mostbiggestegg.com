title: "The Haps"

Doing a bunch of productivity systems looking into, learning how to learn type stuff.

Bought a recorder; should complement the dulcimer as a non-finger-dependent instrument - since rock climbing causes finger stiffness. Speaking of rock climbing, we're doing a [steady state cycle](https://antranik.org/ssc/) for finger (specifically the pockets and 3-finger trios)/elbow/shoulder tendon health + kettlebell skill work, learning all the movements + general kettlebell strength work for training. 

Finally landed someone to fill the empty room; tremendous load off.

Listened to the [Thao and Mirah](https://thaomirah.bandcamp.com/album/thao-mirah) joint and Wiki's [Half God](https://wiksetnyc.bandcamp.com/album/half-god) recently; both prime. Still thinking about my [Deep Cover](https://letterboxd.com/film/deep-cover/) watch; tremendously well-made but also thematically heavy in a way that, like I say, still is bounching around my head.
