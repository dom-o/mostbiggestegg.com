Learning about sumo; taking notes - here they are:
<pre>
shikona: rikishi's ring name
  use of these goes back to Edo period 
    used to attract customers/hide rikishi 
    identities
    
  consists of surname and personal/given name, 
  like a standard japanese name, but personal 
  name is usually not used outside of formal 
  occasions
    eg. takayasu 

  sekitori have own honorific in addition to 
  name: -zeki (instead of -san)

  often rikishi start with their family name and 
  change shikona as they rise through ranks
    that being said, huge variations in shikona/
    naming conventions, based on traditions of 
    the rikishi's stable and the rikishi's own 
    preferences
      -can take shikona based on their stable
        eg. from oguruma stable -> shikona ending 
        in '-kaze' after stable founder kotokaze
      -shikona based on a rikishi from the past 
      they have a connection to
        eg. kotonowaka -> kotozakura, since 
        kotozakura is their grandfather
      -shikona based on their birthplace
        -eg. from hokkaido -> use first character 
        of hokkaido ('hoku'/'kita', meaning north 
        -> kitanoumi)
      -some rikishi simply use their real family 
      names as shikona
        eg. shodai, takayasu
    rikishi can also change their names as they 
    like, sometimes to improve luck/revitalize

  foreign wrestlers usually take shikona at the 
  very beginning of their careers, and often 
  choose shikona that give a clue to their origins
    eg. mongolians often incorporate characters 
    for 'eagle', 'horse', 'wolf', or 'dragon' 
    since these are venerated in mongolia
